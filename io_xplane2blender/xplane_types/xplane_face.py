# A mesh face. This class is just a data wrapper used by <XPlaneFaces>.
class XPlaneFace():
    # Property: vertices
    # list of vectors - [v1,v2,v3] The vertices forming the face.

    # list of vectors - [n1,n2,n3] The normals of each vertice in <vertices>.

    # Property: indices
    # list - [i1,i2,i3] The indices for each vertice in <vertices>.

    # bool - (default=False) True if face is smooth shaded, False if it is flat shaded.
